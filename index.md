# braindump(ag)

<small>
All the items below are called `braindumps`. I kindly ask you to void calling them posts, articles, guides, drafts or even *stupid* web pages. They represent an area of my brain that is currently allocated but, due to context switches and limited resources, might be reallocated and erased. These `braindumps` act as a backup or cache.
