title: "Boot 64bit linux kernel on Raspberry Pi 4"
---

### TL;DR

- guide for compiling Raspberry Pi kernel, stubs (including toolchain and cross-compiler)
- guide for booting Raspberry Pi 4 on a 64bit kernel
- guide for switching Raspbian from 32bit kernel to a 64bit one

There are a couple of things we discovered while adding support in [Yocto/meta-raspberrypi](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi) for the new [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and I realized that they can be a good guide for anyone trying to boot a 64bit kernel for this board with or without a 64bit user-space. I will try to keep this post updated as further development will invalidate items discussed below.

Also, this counts as a guide for building your own kernel along with a minimal aarch64 toolchain and cross-compiler.

## A. Raspberry Pi firmware

If you are working on top of a 32bit [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) distribution (at least `2019-06-20`), you will have all the needed blobs in the boot partition. If you build a distro from scratch or working on a different distro, you will need to include the boot files from a raspberrypi-firmware release version greater or equal to [1.20190620](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/releases/tag/1.20190620).

## B. Compile aarch64 toolchain

```sh
mkdir aarch64-toolchain
cd aarch64-toolchain
export TOOLCHAIN=`pwd`
```

First of all, we will need to compile a set of 'tools'. The first bit is [binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/) which provides, in summary, a linker and an assembler. So we will download the current latest version (tested on 2.32) and compile it:

```sh
cd $TOOLCHAIN
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.32.tar.bz2
tar -xf binutils-2.32.tar.bz2
mkdir binutils-2.32-build
cd binutils-2.32-build
../binutils-2.32/configure --prefix=$TOOLCHAIN --target=aarch64-linux-gnu --disable-nls
make -j4
make install
```

Now you have `binutils` in place. The next step is a C compiler, [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). We will be compiling a very minimal compiler for C that is enough for our use-case. Feel free though to modify the configuration line as wanted.

```sh
cd $TOOLCHAIN
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-9.1.0/gcc-9.1.0.tar.gz
tar -xf gcc-9.1.0.tar.gz
mkdir gcc-9.1.0-build
cd gcc-9.1.0-build
```

GCC will have some dependencies so make sure you have them installed on your host. For example on Ubuntu you will need:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
```

As soon as you have all the needed dependencies installed we can proceed with `GCC` compilation:

```sh
../gcc-9.1.0/configure --prefix=$TOOLCHAIN --target=aarch64-linux-gnu --with-newlib --without-headers --disable-nls --disable-shared --disable-threads --disable-libssp --disable-decimal-float --disable-libquadmath --disable-libvtv --disable-libgomp --disable-libatomic --enable-languages=c
make all-gcc -j4
make install-gcc
```

## C. Build the kernel

Before starting the compilation there are some packages we need on the host. Here is an example on Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install bison flex
```

Compile a Raspberry Pi 4 64bit kernel:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux.git rpi-linux
cd rpi-linux
git checkout 0d3c5fea8c6b309e1e61aae2389a4baf327d2967
mkdir kernel-build
PATH=$PATH:$TOOLCHAIN/bin make O=./kernel-build/ ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-  bcm2711_defconfig
PATH=$PATH:$TOOLCHAIN/bin make -j4 O=./kernel-build/ ARCH=arm64 CROSS_COMPILE=aarch64-linux-gnu-
export KERNEL_VERSION=`cat ./kernel-build/include/generated/utsrelease.h | sed -e 's/.*"\(.*\)".*/\1/'`
make -j4 O=./kernel-build/ DEPMOD=echo MODLIB=./kernel-install/lib/modules/${KERNEL_VERSION} INSTALL_FW_PATH=./kernel-install/lib/firmware modules_install
export KERNEL_BUILD_DIR=`realpath kernel-build` # used if you want to deploy it to raspbian, ignore otherwise
```

This will get us a kernel image, the associated kernel modules and a device tree.

## D. arm8 stub with `BCM2711` support

This is the code that the GPU loads and sets the ARM CPU before running the kernel. This [support](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/commit/7f4a937e1bacbc111a22552169bc890b4bb26a94) for `BCM2711` was not included in the current latest firmware (see above) so you will need to compile and configure the board to use the appropriate one.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git rpi-tools
cd rpi-tools/armstubs
git checkout 7f4a937e1bacbc111a22552169bc890b4bb26a94
PATH=$PATH:$TOOLCHAIN/bin make armstub8.bin
export ARMSTUB=`realpath armstub8.bin` # used if you want to deploy it to raspbian, ignore otherwise
```

## E. Tweak NVRAM configuration for `brcmfmac43455`

Raspbian >= `2019-06-20` includes this change by default so skip if that is what you are working on. Otherwise, the current [firmware-nonfree](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree) uses a NVRAM configuration which renders the WiFi interface unusable. You will need to change `bootflags3` as it follows:

```
boardflags3=0x44200100
```

## X. Yocto support

The current master branch of [meta-raspberrypi](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi) has the support described above. All you need is to set the `MACHINE` to `raspberrypi4-64.conf`. The build system will make all the needed changes for you to be able to boot this board.

## Y. Switch Raspbian `2019.06.20` to 64bit kernel

You now have all the bits to proceed in modifying a Raspbian image to boot a Raspberry Pi 4 board in 64bit mode. If you build a custom distro or working on another distro, take the following guide as reference (or use Yocto - see above).

First thing first, download Raspbian and burn it with any tool you prefer. I'd use [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Mount the boot partition and copy the stub, kernel image and the kernel modules on it. The following commands assume that the boot partition mount point is `/run/media/me/boot`. Also, the paths rely on the exports set throughout this post.

```sh
cp $ARMSTUB /run/media/me/boot
cp $KERNEL_BUILD_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/Image /run/media/me/boot/kernel8.img
cp $KERNEL_BUILD_DIR/arch/arm64/boot/dts/broadcom/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb /run/media/me/boot/
cp -r $KERNEL_BUILD_DIR/kernel-install/* /run/media/me/rootfs/
```

Also we need to configure the `config.txt` file:

```sh
echo "armstub=armstub8-gic.bin" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt 
echo "enable_gic=1" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt 
echo "arm_64bit=1" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt
echo "total_mem=1024" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt
```

The current support is usable but has one big limitation: the memory needs to be capped at 1G. Long story short, if that is ignored, the SD card will not work. See [this](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/cdb78ce891f6c6367a69c0a46b5779a58164bd4b#diff-634f284364ba43ef69912111615b08ef) commit for more details. The `SDHCI` driver can't access addresses above 1G. Obviously, that is going to be fixed so we will get rid of this limitation soon. That is why we limit the RAM in the above configuration.

```sh
sync
umount /run/media/me/boot
```

Pop the microSD card in your board, attach a serial console, boot, login and

```sh
uname -a
Linux raspberrypi 4.19.56-v8+ #1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jul 4 12:43:20 BST 2019 aarch64 GNU/Linux
```

At first boot you will need to run `depmod`. This will generate the `modules.dep` and co files.

```sh
sudo depmod -a
sudo reboot
```

At next boot everything should be up and running, that is a Raspbian 32bit user-space on a 64bit linux kernel.
