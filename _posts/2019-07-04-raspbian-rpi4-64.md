### TL;DR

- this braindump is based on a more general one available [here](https://andrei.gherzan.ro/linux/raspbian-rpi-64/)
- it adds specific quirks currently needed for Raspberry Pi 4

There are a couple of things we discovered while adding support in [Yocto/meta-raspberrypi](https://github.com/agherzan/meta-raspberrypi) for the new [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and I realized that they can be a good guide for anyone trying to boot a 64bit kernel for this board with or without a 64bit user-space. I will try to keep this post updated as further development will invalidate items discussed below.

## A. Raspberry Pi firmware

![Raspberry Pi Logo](/assets/img/rpi-logo.png){:class="image-right"}If you are working on top of a 32bit [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) distribution (at least `2019-06-20`), you will have all the needed blobs in the boot partition. If you build a distro from scratch or working on a different distro, you will need to include the boot files from a raspberrypi-firmware release version greater or equal to [1.20190620](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/releases/tag/1.20190620).

## B. Compile aarch64 toolchain

Initially, this guide included the instructions for building a toolchain and the kernel. That was split out of it because it was useful for other boards as well (see Raspberry Pi 3). Also, all these quirks will be eventually obsolete. That being said, for now, follow the guide [here](https://andrei.gherzan.ro/linux/raspbian-rpi-64/) to build a 64bit kernel for Raspberry Pi 4 (be aware to pick up the right `defconfig`.

## C. arm8 stub with `BCM2711` support

***A new Raspberry Pi firmware was released which includes the needed armstubs support for bcm2838 (bcm2711). It means that you can skip this entire step by just using a newer firmware version. The minimum version needed to avoid having custom stubs is [2019-07-09](https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/releases/tag/1.20190709).***

If you followed the braindump above, you have a toolchain and a kernel compiled. I assume that the exported variables (I define some paths to be able to reference them later) are in place. Otherwise feel free to tweak the instructions below as needed.

The `armstub` is the code that the GPU loads and sets the ARM CPU before running the kernel. This [support](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/commit/7f4a937e1bacbc111a22552169bc890b4bb26a94) for `BCM2711` was not included in the current latest firmware (see above) so you will need to compile and configure the board to use the appropriate one.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git rpi-tools
cd rpi-tools/armstubs
git checkout 7f4a937e1bacbc111a22552169bc890b4bb26a94
PATH=$PATH:$TOOLCHAIN/bin make armstub8.bin # See B above for the TOOLCHAIN path
export ARMSTUB=`realpath armstub8.bin` # used if you want to deploy it to raspbian, ignore otherwise
```

## D. Tweak NVRAM configuration for `brcmfmac43455`

Raspbian >= `2019-06-20` includes this change by default so skip if that is what you are working on. Otherwise, the current [firmware-nonfree](https://github.com/RPi-Distro/firmware-nonfree) uses a NVRAM configuration which renders the WiFi interface unusable. You will need to change `bootflags3` as it follows:

```
boardflags3=0x44200100
```

## E. Switch Raspbian `2019.06.20` to 64bit kernel

Let's deploy now all the needed quirks for a Raspberry Pi 4 running a 64bit kernel on Raspbian.

The following commands assume that the boot partition mount point is `/run/media/me/boot`. Also, the paths rely on the exports set throughout this braindump and the one described in B.

```sh
cp $ARMSTUB /run/media/me/boot
```

Also we need to configure the `config.txt` file:

```sh
echo "armstub=armstub8-gic.bin" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt 
echo "enable_gic=1" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt 
echo "arm_64bit=1" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt
echo "total_mem=1024" >> /run/media/me/boot/config.txt
```

The current support is usable but has one big limitation: the memory needs to be capped at 1G. Long story short, if that is ignored, the SD card will not work. See [this](https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/commit/cdb78ce891f6c6367a69c0a46b5779a58164bd4b#diff-634f284364ba43ef69912111615b08ef) commit for more details. The `SDHCI` driver can't access addresses above 1G. Obviously, that is going to be fixed so we will get rid of this limitation soon. That is why we limit the RAM in the above configuration.

```sh
sync
umount /run/media/me/boot
```

Don't forget running `depmod` at first boot (see B).
